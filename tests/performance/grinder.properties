# The properties can be specified in three ways.
#
#  1) In the console. A properties file in the distribution directory
#     can be selected in the console.
#  2) As a Java system property in the command line used to start the
#     agent. (e.g. java -Dgrinder.threads=20 net.grinder.Grinder).
#  3) In an agent properties file. A local properties file named
#     "grinder.properties" can be placed in the working directory of
#     each agent, or a different file name passed as an agent command
#     line argument.
#
# Properties present in a console selected file take precedence over
# agent command line properties, which in turn override those in
# an agent properties file.
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) is a
# comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a # for
# commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you may wish to
# enable
#
# Please refer to
# http://net.grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/properties.html for further
# documentation.

# The file name of the script to run.
#
# Relative paths are evaluated from the directory containing the
# properties file. The default is "grinder.py".
grinder.script = tests/mycravings_survey_1.py

# The number of worker processes each agent should start. The default
# is 1.
grinder.processes = 1

# The number of worker threads each worker process should start. The
# default is 1.
grinder.threads = 3

# The number of runs each worker process will perform. When using the
# console this is usually set to 0, meaning "run until the console
# sneds a stop or reset signal". The default is 1.
#
# P2C: Use grinder.duration to control the duration. Goal: how many
# transactions in 60K ms (60 seconds)
grinder.runs = 0

# The maximum length of time in milliseconds that each worker process
# should run for. grinder.duration can be specified in conjunction
# with grinder.runs, in which case the worker processes will terminate
# if either the duration time or the number of runs is exceeded. The
# default is to run forever.
grinder.duration = 300000

# The directory in which worker process logs should be created. If not
# specified, the agent's working directory is used.
grinder.logDirectory = log

# The number of archived logs from previous runs that should be kept.
# The default is 1.
grinder.numberOfOldLogs = 2
